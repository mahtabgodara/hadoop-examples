Install maven using from the installation section on the following URL:

Installation instructions: http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation


Run the following commands to create a hadoop project under your workspace directory:

mkdir wordcount
cd wordcount

mvn archetype:generate 

It would start creating the project in interactive mode and ask you for inputs such as
Choose a number or apply filter (format: [groupId:]artifactId, case sensitive contains): 16: 
Define value for property 'groupId': : com.training.hadoop.examples
Define value for property 'artifactId': : wordcount
Define value for property 'version':  1.0-SNAPSHOT: : 
Define value for property 'package':  com.training.hadoop.examples: : 
Confirm properties configuration:
groupId: com.training.hadoop.examples
artifactId: wordcount
version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT
package: com.training.hadoop.examples
 Y: : Y
 
The values entered/selected should look like above.

on successful completion, you should see a directory with the artifactId(wordcount) in the current directory with a project structure such as:

wordcount
   |-src
   |---main
   |-----java
   |-------com
   |---------training
   |-----------hadoop
   |-------------examples
   |-----------------App.java
   |---test
   |-----java
   |-------com
   |---------training
   |-----------hadoop
   |-------------examples
   |----------------AppTest.java
   |-pom.xml
   
To make it a hadoop project, add the following dependency under the dependencies section:

	<dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.hadoop</groupId>
        <artifactId>hadoop-core</artifactId>
        <version>1.2.1</version>
    </dependency>
 
Lets make the project eclipse compatible so that the project can be imported into eclipse for development. Run the following command for that in your project directory (wordcount)
 
mvn eclipse:eclipse 

Import the project in eclipse:

1. Open eclipse 
2. File -> import -> Existing Project into Workspace -> Select the project directory (wordcount) -> Finish

The project is imported in eclipse with all the dependencies. You can now write Mapper/Reducer and Driver classes for your Hadoop Jobs.

You can either export the project as a jar file using the file export option or right click on the pom.xml file -> Run As -> maven install . That would result into a jar file under the target directory that is under your project directory.

You can now run the jar file with hadoop as:

hadoop jar <project-dir-location>/target/wordcount-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <AbsolutePathToDriverClass> <input-dir> <output-dir>
